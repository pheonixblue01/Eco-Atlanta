    <h1>Eco-Atlanta High Level Design</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Conceptual Design</h3>
    <br>
    <p> The Eco-Atlanta website will use CSS stylesheets to maintain a coherent,
      uniform appearance. The site will utilize a database for user information
      and forum content. All pages will feature a navigation sidebar with
      hyperlink buttons allowing easy access to all areas of the site from any
      other part of the site. </p>
    <br>
    <center><img  src="./pics/sitemap.jpeg" style="width:65%;"></center>
    <br>
    <h3>Media Types</h3>
    <p> The Eco-Atlanta site will use images with file formats .gif, .jpg, or
      .png, which may be uploaded by users or site administration. There may be
      embedded video on various parts of the site which will most likely be
      embedded from YouTube or another web source, but may be uploaded by site
      administration if original content is needed. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Individual Page Details</h3>
    <h5>Homepage</h5>
    <p> The Homepage of the Eco-Atlanta website will display the Eco-Atlanta
      logo as well as images of/links to upcoming important events, breaking
      news, or other site material deemed especially useful or interesting by
      site administrators. There will be text, images, and potentially video. </p>
    <h5>Register</h5>
    <p> The Registration sub-page will allow users to create an account with a
      username and password. This account will allow users to participate in the
      forum and group features of Eco-Atlanta. The Registration page will
      consist of text and a form users may fill out and submit to become
      members. </p>
    <h5>Forum</h5>
    <p> The Forum sub-page will allow registered users to begin discussions on
      topics of their choice and contribute to discussions with other users. The
      Forum pages will be constructed with PHP and MySQL, and will consist
      primarily of text but allow users to upload images as well. </p>
    <h5>Groups</h5>
    <p> The Groups sub-page will allow registered users to form a Facebook-style
      group for specific interests within the scope of environmental activism.
      For example, there may be a group for users that want to be active in
      trash-pickup days around the city in particular. Groups may involve
      group-specific forums, newsletters, and contact information availability
      for other group members. The Group page will use text, images, and
      possibly videos - similar to the Forum page. </p>
    <h5>Learn</h5>
    <p> The Learn sub-pages will consist of news, articles, how-to guides, and
      infographics related to Eco-Atlanta's mission of spreading environmental
      awareness in the Atlanta area. This content will include text, images, and
      embedded video created or selected by site administration. </p>
    <h5>Events</h5>
    <p> The Events sub-page will have a monthly calendar so that users can see
      upcoming environmental-related events, such as volunteer opportunities,
      workshops, and meetings. Registered users will be able to sign up for
      events that require advance registration. The Events sub-page will use
      text and images. </p>
    <h5>Links</h5>
    <p> The Links portion of the site will be a directory of local organizations
      that are related to the goals of Eco-Atlanta. There will be an
      alphabetical listing of businesses, nonprofits, and other groups that are
      providing eco-friendly services or opportunities to be involved in the
      environmental action community. Users may view short descriptions of each
      organization and access a link to each organization's website. </p>
    <h5>Visiting Atlanta</h5>
    <p> The Visiting Atlanta area of the site will provide reference information
      for visitors to the Atlanta area who wish to minimize their environmental
      impact while enjoying their stay. There will be links to eco-friendly
      businesses and information about environmentally sound activities in the
      area. There will be text, images, and potentially video in this area of
      the site. </p>
    <h5>Help</h5>
    <p> The Help section will involve two subcategories, a FAQ and a
      trouble-ticket submission area. The FAQ will have generalized solutions to
      problems or questions users may have regarding the site or related
      material, and the trouble-ticket area will allow users to submit feedback
      forms regarding site issues. The Help pages will use text and images. </p>
